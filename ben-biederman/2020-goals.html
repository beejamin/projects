  <h2>My 2020 Goals</h2>
  <h5>- Published January 24, 2020 -</h5>
  
  <p>Admittedly I’m not big into New Year’s resolutions. I think the idea of waiting for some future date to start hustling is a little backwards to me. With that being said, these are some of the things I’d like to accomplish in 2020. Some of these goals had the foundation already laid at the end of 2019, so that may be considered cheating, but that’s okay with me. Here’s what I’m aiming for this year:</p>
    
  <div class="goals-blog">
  <h4>Create personal website:</h4>
  <p>If you’re reading this – good news, I achieved this goal. This is one of the first things I’m planning on doing in 2020. Despite having a marketing degree, I’m not too active on personal social media. I see the value of it from a business standpoint, but don’t seem to enjoy it as much from a personal standpoint. With that being said, having a personal website seems like a valuable investment of my time and energy.</p>
  
  <h4>Read 20 books:</h4>
  <p>20 books doesn’t seem like too lofty of a goal, but let me explain. The last few years I’ve been reading an average of 40 books. However, after some self-reflection, I’ve realized that I was doing too much reading and not enough action. I thought I’d read my way into success, which while I’ve learned a lot of great information, it didn’t necessarily get me closer to my goals. Prior to the end of 2019, I would read on my lunch break at work and 60-90 minutes prior to going to sleep. I decided to start bringing my personal laptop to work in order to be able to work harder to achieve my goals on my lunch break rather than reading another book. I’m excited to see how that helps me in 2020.</p>
  
  <h4>Rebuild side hustle website:</h4>
  <p>In 2019 I ran into some issues with my side hustle website. It no longer would load on mobile for Android users due to an update to Chrome. I was using Adobe Muse to build my websites at this time. Due to this issue, I needed to create a new website. I contemplated using Wix or SquareSpace but I didn’t like how much it restricted you. I thought to myself, if I’m going to learn a new way of building a website by doing it through Wix or SquareSpace, I may as well learn how to code a website from scratch. I enrolled in an online course which laid a great foundation for HTML/CSS, but I definitely had no idea what I was doing outside of the course. Thankfully there are a lot of great books and resources online. I slowly pieced it together to create a new website that was fully responsive. While it did its job, it was riddled with coding errors. My goal in 2020 is to take my knowledge I now have, without having to rush building a new website, and make it right.</p>
 
  <h4>Learn JavaScript:</h4>
  <p>The fun thing about a side hustle is that it forces you into doing things you never thought you’d do. This allows you to get new experiences that you may really enjoy, that otherwise you’d never think to try. This is how I felt with HTML/CSS. I really took to coding websites and the process of it. I’d like to continue this and take the next steps to learning JavaScript. This would allow me to bring my websites to a whole new level and maybe open up a career opportunity to me.</p>
  
  <h4>Learn to make homemade pasta:</h4>
  <p>One thing about me is that I don’t enjoy cutting corners. When it comes to cooking, there’s a BIG difference between fresh pasta and boxed pasta. I’d like to learn how to make some amazing homemade pasta in 2020. In the past I focused on learning to make homemade pizzas, so this would really up my homemade carb game. It’s definitely an outlier from the rest of my goals thus far, but I’m just as excited about it.</p>
  
  <h4>Obtain Google Analytics certificate:</h4>
  <p>I get a decent amount of traffic to my side hustle website. While I can understand the high level analytics when I look at them, I’d like to really have a good idea of how to dive in further and how I can better that data. Obtaining my Google Analytics certificate will not only assist with that, but it’ll allow me to also provide more value to others.</p>
  
  <h4>Identify areas to monetize side hustle:</h4>
  <p>With my side hustle I’ve built a pretty decent sized following. As of writing these goals, I have just over 18,000 likes on the Facebook page. During the football season, my website gets a decent amount of traffic despite the issues that it has, which will be corrected this year. With those factors mentioned, I’d like to be able to make some money from it.</p>
  
  <h4>Get ordained:</h4>
  <p>When I began putting together my goals for 2020, never did I imagine that this would be on the list. However, recently a good friend reached out to me about performing the wedding and marrying them. I have absolutely zero experience with doing something like this, but you can't say no to that request. So getting ordained it is!</p>
   
  </div>
  <br>
  
  <p>With it currently being early January of 2020 at the time of writing these out, I’m confident this list isn’t complete quite yet. This list will continue to grow and develop as the year continues, but having a rough idea of what I’d like to complete this year will help me in my goal planning. Just writing all of these goals out has me excited to get to work and excited for what I’ll be like at the end of 2020. Let’s get to work!</p>
