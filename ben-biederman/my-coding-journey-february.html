  <h2>My Coding Journey - February</h2>
  <h5>- Published February 14, 2020 -</h5>
  
  <p>With JavaScript being one of my biggest goals for 2020, I thought it may be beneficial to do a monthly update on my coding journey. This will assist me in reflecting on what I need to really hone in on for coding, but may also be able to help anyone who is looking to learn front-end web development themselves. Before I dive too far into February’s update, I do want to clarify that prior to starting this I had zero computer science background. In fact, before a year ago, I didn’t even know a single thing about programming or markup languages. The more I think about it, my only experience with HTML was from my Myspace days, but that was just copying and pasting the templates. Shout-out to you, Tom.</p>
    
  <p>You may be wondering what brought me down this path of trying to learn front-end web development in the first place, or you may not care at all, but since this is the first post about my coding journey I’m going to tell you regardless. Back in 2017 I created a side hustle that assists individuals who are coming to Green Bay on places to eat, drink, or see while in Green Bay. With it being a big tourist city thanks to the Packers, it was welcomed and appreciated by fans searching for that information. I had built my website with Adobe Muse since it allowed me to really customize my website how I wanted. Fast forward to 2019, I noticed my website was no longer loading on my cellphone. After a quick Google search, I realized that Chrome had updated and had stopped redirecting mobile users to a mobile version of a website. Instead you had to have your website be fully responsive. This meant I had to rebuild my website from scratch to make it fully responsive. After thinking about it for a day or two, I decided that if I were needing to rebuild my website either way, I may as well do it using HTML/CSS. I had concerns that if I rebuilt my website with Adobe Muse that I could one day run into this issue again and be in the same spot. I was also concerned with how Adobe seems to be focusing their attention to other programs than Muse (rightfully so), this could result in the program becoming outdated in the future and thus leaving me up creek without a paddle.</p>
  
  <p>This decision to learn HTML/CSS turned out to be one of the best I could have made. From the moment I started working with HTML/CSS I was hooked. The beautiful thing about this language is that it feels easy enough to get the grasp of what you’re doing, but difficult enough to keep you thinking. If you’re reading this and looking to go this route, there are three things I’d recommend:</p>

   <figcaption>HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett is a must have book for anyone looking to learn HTML & CSS. I still reference to it regularly. It's a beautifully laid out reference.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <div class="goals-blog">
  <p>1. <a href="https://amzn.to/38ZUdTh" target="_blank">Purchase HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett</a>. This book is my bible when it comes to HTML and CSS. There’s so much great information and it’s easy to reference to. I keep it by my desk at all times.</p>
  
  <p>2. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css" target="_blank">Complete the HTML and CSS course on Codecademy.com</a>. It will really lay a good foundation for you to proceed forward learning HTML and CSS.</p>
  
  <p>3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItYye9h_RXg&list=PL0eyrZgxdwhxNGMWROnaY35NLyEjTqcgB" target="_blank">Watch MMTUTS YoutTube series on HTML and CSS</a>. It’s over 40 videos long at the time of writing this, but don’t let that deter you. Daniel is a great teacher and does a fantastic job of really explaining what he’s doing and how to make your website fully responsive.</p>
 
  </div>

  <p>While you go through those steps, don’t be afraid to start playing around with HTML & CSS on your own. The Codecademy and MMTUTS series lay a really good foundation for getting a general idea of what you’re doing, but without actually doing the coding, you won’t know what you’re doing fully. Also, don’t be discouraged if you do those three steps and still get stumped while coding. I remember the first website I built (which was prettttyyy bad) had me stumped numerous times throughout the process. Keep at it, I promise you will get it. If I can do it, I know you can do it as well!</p>
  
  <p>Since building my first website with HTML and CSS, I’ve built numerous websites. Some were just fun little projects to help me get better at coding, others were built with the intention of going live. Each time I build a new website I seem to learn something new. I have absolutely loved this learning process and wanted to further explore what I could do with a website. The love of this learning process is what moved me to decide to start learning JavaScript.</p>
  
  <p>At the time of writing this post, my game plan is to follow the same process that I did for HTML and CSS for JavaScript. I’ve already purchased JavaScript and jQuery by Jon Duckett, which I’ve been slowly working my way through. To go along with that reading, I just completed a course on Codecademy called Building Interactive JavaScript Websites. Much like with HTML and CSS, I feel this is building a good foundation for learning JavaScript, but in order to fully get a grasp of the language I have to start coding it myself. I’m optimistic that by the next update I give on my coding journey, I’ll be able to have some JavaScript features implemented on my website. I feel like one area of knowledge I’m lacking yet is fully understanding all that JavaScript can do for a website. Finally, I’m going to be starting MMTUTS’ JavaScript series this weekend to build the best foundation I possibly can on learning JavaScript. It’s a tough road, but I’m excited for the journey.</p>
   
  <p>I’m sure this wasn’t the most exciting blog post I’ve ever written, however I think it’s an important one. I wanted to set that foundation for what I’m working on to help encourage anyone to do the same if they feel they want to. Coding in general can feel so overwhelming and out of your capabilities, but I promise you it’s possible. I’ll continue to update each month on the progress I’m making on my coding journey. I appreciate you for taking the time to read it. If you have any questions about getting started or anything that I can help with, please do not hesitate to shoot me an email.</p>
