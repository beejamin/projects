  <h2>My 2020 Goals - January Update</h2>
  <h5>- Published January 31, 2020 -</h5>
  
  <p>I feel like I had to do a double check at the calendar, I cannot believe it’s already the end of January. The time sure does fly when you’re having fun. I figured this was a good opportunity to give an update on my 2020 goals and how they’re progressing. In terms of my <a href="2020-goals.html">2020 goals</a>, January was a very productive month. Let’s review my yearly goals and give an update:</p>
    
  <div class="goals-blog">
  <h4>Create personal website:</h4>
   <p>This goal was one of my first priorities for 2020. As stated in my <a href="2020-goals.html">2020 goals</a> blog post, I don’t use social media from a personal standpoint anymore, so getting this launched will be beneficial for me as I look to grow. I didn’t immediately start on this website, but was able to complete and upload it before the end of the month, which I was happy about. It’s by no means a perfect website yet, it’s quite bare, but I’ll keep working on growing it. I figured it’s better to get it live than to keep trying to perfect it forever.</p>
   
   <div class="status">
    <p>Status:</p>
    <p class="completed">Completed</p>
   
   </div>
  
  <h4>Read 20 books:</h4>
  <p>Welp, I’m officially behind on this goal. Thankfully I have a lot of time to catch up. However, I haven’t completed a single book this month. I seem to be using all my free time to work on different tasks and goals. I’m currently reading Boss Life by Paul Downs and JavaScript for Dummies. It feels weird that I haven’t completed a book this month, but I’ve been extremely productive in other areas to make up for it.</p>

   </div>
  
  <h4>Rebuild side hustle website:</h4>
  <p>Excited to announce that this has officially been completed in one sense but still a work in progress in another sense. This is what I started the month focusing on since I knew it was going to take some time. I have nearly 100 pages on my website, so I knew it was going to be time consuming to rework it, but I’m happy it’s done. I’m excited with how it turned out and the progress I’ve made from the first time I’ve created it. It is really crazy to me how much more comfortable I feel with HTML/CSS since the first time I built the website. As I learn more JavaScript, I'll be reworking it again to incorporate JavaScript into the website, but I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.</p>

  <h4>Learn JavaScript:</h4>
  <p>I’m anticipating this is going to be the goal that takes me the longest to complete this year. I’ve enrolled in some online classes to help me get a better understanding of JavaScript. I’m currently taking a course on Codecademy.com for front-end web development. I’ll continue to read JavaScript for Dummies until I complete that, after JavaScript for Dummies I have a book by Jon Duckett to read as well. Eventually I’ll start implementing JavaScript into my side hustle website and this website.</p>

  <h4>Learn to make homemade pasta:</h4>
  <p>For Christmas my girlfriend got me the KitchenAid pasta attachments. I’m not going to lie to you, it’s a little sad how excited I was about this. During January I made homemade pasta three different times. I’m surprised how easy it is to make it, especially when you have the attachments. The recipe is beyond simple, only requiring two ingredients: flour and eggs. I’m excited to continue the journey of making homemade pasta and saying what else I can do with it. Homemade tomato sauce next?</p>

  <h4>Obtain Google Analytics certificate:</h4>
  <p>Zero progress made on this goal thus far. Maybe come February I can start this process, but with the focus on JavaScript right now, I’ve been spending my time absorbing as much of that as possible. Still very much a priority for me this year, though.</p>

  <h4>Identify areas to monetize side hustle:</h4>
  <p>I haven’t put a ton of thought into this quite yet. My side hustle is built around the Green Bay Packers, which their season just ended mid-January. This gives me plenty of time to reflect fully on monetization and what I’d like to do. Some quick ideas to monetize would be sponsorship on content, banner ads at the bottom of the website, and sell merchandise. I have some items for sale on my website right now, but it was never something that was hyped up or marketed fully. I’ll change that this year if I do some merchandise.</p>
   
   <div class="status">
    <p>Status:</p>
    <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>
   
   </div>
  
  <h4>Get ordained:</h4>
  <p>I’ve done a little bit of research on this so far and that’s about it. This is definitely something I can’t slack on though because the wedding will be here before you know it and I don’t want to leave them high and dry. I’m thinking February I’ll need to get ordained in case there is any lag time on the process.</p>

  <p>After seeing the progress I’ve made in January alone, I can see that I’ll need to continue adding to my list of goals for this year so I can get the most out of 2020 as I possibly can. Obviously as the year continues onward, I’m sure more things will come up to add to it, I just want to make sure I don’t get complacent with what I’ve done for the year. We’re 1/12 the way done with 2020, let’s make the most of it. Let’s get to work!</p>
