  <h2>Thanks for everything, Zuck.</h2>

  <p>Social media is great, isn’t it? You can keep up with what your friends are doing, creep on someone you may have just met, or see what that one person is up to since high school. It allows you to keep in touch with distant friends or relatives in ways that you never could before, but there’s also a down side to social media. People generally only post things they’re excited to share or that they’re proud of. It can create some very false cognitive biases.</p>
    
  <p>Ever since 2008 I had been an avid Facebook user. Like most people I used it as a way to keep up with the world around me. I would share photos, update my status, and interact with friends on there. I would wake up each morning and without even thinking of it, I’d start scrolling my timeline. Who doesn't love starting your day with a dopamine hit? In one of the books I was reading in 2018 (the book escapes me now at this point), they were talking about dopamine. I hadn’t been too familiar with it, but I had learned that it’s a chemical released by your brain that makes us feel good. It’s part of a reward system. If you think about the feeling you get when you win at the slot machines – that’s dopamine. Receiving a notification on social media creates that same dopamine hit. In fact, a lot of social media companies have algorithms that are similar to slot machines. Some statuses will get rewarded with high interaction, while others will barely get any interaction. The social media companies do this intentionally to allow for big hits of dopamine while using their product. This helps keep you coming back for more. Knowing this, I wanted to see what would happen if I stopped using my personal Facebook account for a while. I was quite surprised by the results.</p>
  
  <p>I’d be lying if I said it was easy to do or there weren’t any drawbacks to this experiment. There were many times people I’m really close to would make plans or would make a big announcement solely on Facebook. I understand the convenience of Facebook but ultimately feel like it takes away that intimate bond you maintain by personally sharing good news or making plans. I think a lot of people have gotten so used to the convenience of Facebook that they only think to share news that way. The other downside is that it felt at times as if you didn’t have many friends. I realized that certain friends that I had felt close with, was nothing more than an interaction here or there on Facebook that made us still feel close. Once I stopped using Facebook, it seemed like any interactions ended as well. On the flip side, there were friendships that seemed to strengthen due to this experiment. More genuine conversations being had, rather than giving a thumbs up on a post.</p>

  <p>I’m embarrassed to admit this, but during the first week of not using social media I had found myself clicking on the Facebook app numerous times a day out of habit. I had logged out of my account on both mobile and desktop to avoid the notifications that come with it. I couldn’t believe how many times a day I’d click on it mindlessly just to start scrolling. One thing I noticed during the first week was how little I actually missed Facebook itself. The lack of notifications almost seemed relaxing. I no longer found myself irritated from reading ignorant Facebook comments on a post made by a page or from seeing something I didn’t agree with posted by a close friend or family member. One of the biggest perks to me was not seeing political posts all the time. It was a breath of fresh air to disconnect from that. It really allowed me to expose myself to things that I wanted exposing to. Disconnecting from Facebook made me realize how little value it was actually bringing to my life.</p>
  
  <p>After a month of trying this, I logged into Facebook for the first time. After looking at what I’ve missed over the past 30 days I realized that I didn’t miss a damn thing. Sure I may have missed some invites or new announcements from friends or family, but ultimately I decided if they truly want me to know, they would shoot me a text or phone call. I may be old school in thinking that way, but that’s how I feel. I personally believe that social media is doing the opposite of what it’s selling to us. It’s not bringing us closer, it’s creating more separation in most cases.</p>
  
  <p>For nearly a year I operated my personal Facebook like this. I’d check it once a month, realize I didn’t miss a whole lot, and then log back out. Recently I decided that Facebook was ultimately bringing me no value on my personal Facebook page. I decided to deactivate it to really take that next step of removing myself from that platform. Full disclosure, I still have my Facebook page for my side hustle. I still regularly post there and use it. To me, it feels very different from having my personal Facebook page since I don’t do any mindless scrolling. I also think the fact that you feel like a separate being helps as well since I’m not posting too personal of photos or information.</p>

   <figcaption>A really good book on how our this topic. It covers social medias as well as your smart phone in general. Very eye opening information, I would highly suggest checking it out.</figcaption>

  <p>I encourage you to take this same challenge. Give up a social media you love to use most for 30 days. If you’re feeling extra brave, give up all social media for 30 days. It won’t be easy to break those habits, but I know you can do it. I think you’ll find that you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the results. If you find yourself wanting to try this experiment or learn more, I’d highly recommend reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2wM4m86" target="_blank">Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport</a>. His book really help solidify me in my decision to quit my personal Facebook all the together. It’s a fantastic read and I couldn’t encourage it enough.</p>
  
  <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this post.

I’d love to hear about your story or any answer any questions you may have. See you next week.</p>
