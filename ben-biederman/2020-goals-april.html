        <h2>My 2020 Goals - April Update</h2>
        <h5>- Published April 30, 2020 -</h5>

        <p>Time flies when you’re being quarantined! Unreal to think we nearly halfway through the year. It’s that time again to check in on how my goals are coming along for 2020. </p>

        <div class="goals-blog">
            <h4>Create personal website:</h4>
            <p>Completed in February 2020 (as you can see, you're on it)</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="completed">Completed</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Read 20 books:</h4>
            <p>Still behind on this goal, and I’m quite okay with that. I feel like I’m devoting more time to learning this year rather than just reading about learning. However, I’m starting to kick up my reading a bit from where I was earlier in the year. I’ve read roughly 6 or 7 books YTD. I’m confident I can hit the 20 mark by the end of the year.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Rebuild side hustle website:</h4>
            <p>Completed in March of 2020.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.thegreenbayguy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feel free to check out the website for yourself.</a></p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="completed">Completed</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Learn JavaScript:</h4>
            <p>Still cruising away on this. I didn’t focus on it 100% in April since I had some other things I was working on as well, but I did enroll in a course on JavaScript and I’ve been working my way through it. Still a big priority this year.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Learn to make homemade pasta:</h4>
            <p>Loved that I was able to learn this. I've been enjoying a lot of carbs this year, especially during this quarantine!</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="completed">Completed</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Obtain Google Analytics certificate:</h4>
            <p>I’ve obtained one certificate, will keep working my way through the others as I see appropriate.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Identify areas to monetize side hustle:</h4>
            <p>I’ve started the brainstorming process on monetizing my side hustle more. I haven’t lined up every single item I’d like to do or the best way to go about everything. I still have some time, but any remaining time I have will go quickly.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Get ordained:</h4>
            <p>I’m officially Reverend Biederman, at least that’s what I’ve been getting referred to in some emails by the place that ordained me. I’m by no means 100% confident in what I’m doing yet and the quarantine doesn’t help with that. I’ve tried getting more information from the Clerk of Courts but no one is in to assist right now. Hopefully this clears up shortly so I can figure everything out. I also hope this doesn’t jeopardize my ability to perform my friend’s wedding.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Learn SEO:</h4>
            <p>I haven’t had an opportunity to take any more courses on SEO, I’ve been focusing on taking a step to practice SEO, which I’ll cover more below.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Create a new side project:</h4>
            <p>I spent a lot of time in April on this. I’ve been working on building a website for this side project. This side project is going to give me a better opportunity to practice SEO, web development, video editing, photography, and more. I’ve been enjoying the process a lot lately since it’s something I’m passionate about. Maybe next month I’ll debut it.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

        </div>
        <br>

        <p></p>

        <p>As I reflect on April, I realize I didn’t get as much done as I would have liked to get done. To be honest though, I’m okay with it. With currently living through a quarantine, I’ve been trying to do things that keep me mentally sane. I’ve spent a lot of time working on my yard and doing projects around my house to help break up being inside. I’ve been also doing a lot of thinking about what I’d like to do with my life. I enjoy web development, but wonder if it’s something I’d ever be good enough to do full-time. It just seems to be one of those periods where you get stuck in your own head. For now, I’m going to just keep working towards goals and keep learning. Whatever is going to happen will happen, until then, I’m going to enjoy the ride. See you in May!</p>
