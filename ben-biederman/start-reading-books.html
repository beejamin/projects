  <h2>How To Start Reading Books Again</h2>
  <h5>- Published March 6, 2020 -</h5>
  
  <p>Prior to 2016 I couldn’t be bothered with a book. I hadn’t read a book willingly since my childhood. The only ones I’d read were because they were assigned to me in class, and even then I’d usually just get the spark notes instead of reading them. In 2016 that changed though, I made it a mission to learn how to start reading books. I don’t mean reading books as in reading the words, I obviously knew how to do that already, I wanted to learn how to start reading books and really getting a lot out of it. I set out a rather adventurous goal of reading one book a week, 52 books in 52 weeks. I was quickly surprised by what I encountered on this journey. If you’re on the same mission as I was, here’s how I tackled my goal.</p>
    
  <div class="goals-blog">
  <h4>Get excited about reading</h4>
   <p>To start my journey, I knew if I wanted to be successful I had to change my current mindset. Anytime I thought about reading, my mind automatically correlated reading with all the times you were forced to read a book for an assignment in school, regardless of your interest level in the book. To combat this, I knew I would have find some books that really excited me to read them. I decided to take a couple of hours and go explore my local Barnes and Noble. I wanted to take my time and go through every section of books so I could find that book that made me excited to read it. After exploring I found a few books that I was eager to start reading.</p>
  
  <h4>Set times you’ll read</h4>
  <p>I decided that if I were serious about becoming a reader, I’d utilize some extra time I had around reading. Every day for work I’d take an hour lunch break. During this break I’d often times go home and watch TV or play on my phone. Going forward, I decided that I would instead stay at the office and read instead. Reading every day during my lunch cemented it into a habit for me. At work I had no other alternative entertainment, so I could focus on my book distraction free. Along with that hour, I decided an hour before bed would be a nice way to end my day rather than scrolling mindlessly on my phone. After a while, I noticed that reading during my lunch allowed me to almost reset my brain. The second half of my days seemed easier to manage and far less hectic. I also noticed that my new habit of reading an hour before bed made it much easier for me to fall asleep due to less screen time right before going to sleep. Those weren’t benefits I was expecting prior to starting reading, but it definitely made continuing in on this process easier.</p>
     
  <h4>Treat yo self</h4>
  <p>As Donna and Tom from Parks and Rec. so wisely said, “Treat yo self”. When it came to books, I made sure to take their advice. Every time I got paid, I would order a book or two. This would keep reading fresh and exciting. It was almost like re-living the book fair as a kid, except that I was actually getting books during it. Every time I got paid, I’d take 20 to 30 minutes to scour over books that just came out, or books that were highly rated. I created this enjoyable experience that hyped up the book before it even arrived. By the time the package was delivered, I’d be eager to get started on the book(s).</p>
 
  <h4>Make it enjoyable</h4>
  <p>A few months into my goal, I found myself reading periodically when I had some free time. I’m an avid coffee drinker, so I’d make a pot of coffee in the morning, and would find myself reading while enjoying a cup of coffee. This made reading an even better experience for me as I was pairing it with something else that I found enjoyable. At the time, there was no better way to start or end my day than by having a nice cup of coffee while reading on the balcony of my apartment. Even as I type this it makes me want to grab a cup of coffee and go relax out in the sun with a book.</p>
     
  <h4>Document it</h4>
  <p>One thing I enjoyed during the process of becoming a reader was taking some notes on the books I was reading. I enjoy reading non-fiction books, mainly business, finance, self-help, etc. I loved writing down anything of value that I got out of the book. Whether it was a fun fact, or something that could be useful for me. It really help me reference the material again in the future. Having this notebook also allowed me to document books that I’d want to read in the future. Some authors would have sections in the back of the book of books they’d recommend reading. I’d jot down books into my notebook to create a list of books that could be interesting to read. </p>
   
  <p>On a side note as it relates to how I made sure I keeping up on my goal, one tactic I used was to calculate how many pages I’d have to read each day in order to complete my goal. I’d take the book I was planning on reading, divide the amount of pages in the book by 7, and that’s how many pages I had to read each day. I realize this probably seems counterintuitive since it’s making it feel like a homework assignment, but I think it was more to help me stay on track with my goals. The way my brain works, it made me want to read more to get ahead of my goal for the next day. </p>

  <p>After 52 weeks I had read 60 books in total. Since completing this goal, I haven’t set out to make it a goal again. However, despite it no longer being a goal of mine, I still average 30 books a year that I’m reading. It’s created quite a positive impact in my life and I’m hopeful that if you followed these steps, it could do the same for you.
