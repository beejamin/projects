        <h2>My 2020 Goals - March Update</h2>
        <h5>- Published March 27, 2020 -</h5>

        <p>I feel like a broken record, I cannot believe it’s the end of another month. March wasn’t the most productive from a goal completion standpoint. However, it allowed me to work on or complete some of the more time intensive goals I may have. Let’s talk about it and see where I’m at.</p>

        <div class="goals-blog">
            <h4>Create personal website:</h4>
            <p>Completed in February 2020 (as you can see, you're on it)</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="completed">Completed</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Read 20 books:</h4>
            <p>I am super behind on this goal and honestly, I’m okay with this. In the past I felt like I read too much and let too much on the table as far as my goals. I’m trying to take the opposite approach this year and see what comes of it. I think I’ve read 3 – 4 books so far. I’m currently reading a couple different books. I’m currently reading The World Atlas of Coffee: From Beans to Brewing – Coffees Explored, Explained Enjoyed by James Hoffmann and JavaScript and JQuery by Jon Duckett. They’re both very interesting to me, but tough to read before bed because they tend to keep me up thinking rather than helping me relax prior to bed. If I miss the goal of reading 20 books this year, I’m okay with that. I’m still reading and enjoying what I’m reading, the quantity this year isn’t the most important thing to me. </p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Rebuild side hustle website:</h4>
            <p>This is where I spent a lot of my March. I have over 150 webpages on my side hustle website that I rebuilt from scratch. The funny thing about learning a new skill like building websites is that you’re always learning new and better ways to do something. It seems like every time I finish my side hustle website; I decide to rebuild it again because I learn something new. I hope I’m done with the rebuilds on it for a while. I’m excited with how it turned out.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="completed">Completed</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Learn JavaScript:</h4>
            <p>In April this will go back to being the focus of my attention. I’ve completed some courses on Codecademy on JavaScript. I honestly may do them a second time as a refresher and just to see where my memory of it all stands. The more I can pound it into my head, the better. I’d also like to complete MMTUTS online JavaScript videos he put together. He does a really good job of explaining what your code is doing and that may be beneficial for me. </p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Learn to make homemade pasta:</h4>
            <p>Loved that I was able to learn this. I've been enjoying a lot of carbs this year, especially during this quarantine!</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="completed">Completed</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Obtain Google Analytics certificate:</h4>
            <p>Since the March update, I’ve completed the beginner’s course on Google Analytics. It’s helped me better read some of the data and well as learn how to sort through some of the information. I plan on continuing these classes to keep bettering my Google Analytic knowledge. </p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Identify areas to monetize side hustle:</h4>
            <p>This goal will become more of a focus this month now that I’ve rebuilt my website. I felt like for the sake of user experience and SEO, if my website were rebuilt it’d be more beneficial right now to me than figuring out a product line or any other merch. I have some ideas of what I’m looking to do and will further expand those ideas this month to get started on everything. </p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Get ordained:</h4>
            <p>I’m officially Reverend Biederman, at least that’s what I’ve been getting referred to in some emails by the place that ordained me. I’m by no means 100% confident in what I’m doing yet and the quarantine doesn’t help with that. I’ve tried getting more information from the Clerk of Courts but no one is in to assist right now. Hopefully this clears up shortly so I can figure everything out. I also hope this doesn’t jeopardize my ability to perform my friend’s wedding.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Learn SEO:</h4>
            <p>In March I completed a course on SEO from Udemy. There was a lot of good information, but also some outdated information on this course. I’d like to take another course and work on putting this information into practice. I created a new side project to assist me in this. I’ll continue to learn more about SEO as the year goes on, that way I can utilize it for any of my projects.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Create a new side project:</h4>
            <p>During March I spent a lot of time getting this started as well. I’m not putting a ton of pressure on it to do well, just want to have fun with it all. This will also allow me to have a website where I can work towards implementing more JavaScript and SEO. I’ll wait to announce this project until I’m a little deeper into it, but so far I’ve been enjoying it. </p>

            <div class="status">
                <p>Status:</p>
                <p class="in-progress">In Progress</p>

            </div>

        </div>
        <br>

        <p>Honestly, it blows my mind that we're nearly into April already. I feel like before you know we'll be welcoming 2021. I'm excited to continue striving towards my goals of 2020. I can't wait to see what comes of them.</p>
