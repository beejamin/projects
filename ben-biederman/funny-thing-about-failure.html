  <h2>The Funny Thing About Failure</h2>
  <h5>- Published February 7, 2020 -</h5>
  
  <p>Failure is such a funny thing. It seems we all do our best to avoid failing. We get stuck in this rut of doing something day in and day out that doesn’t seem to fit our goals or dreams because we’re too busy worrying about failing. We worry that if we fail, that we’re going to be humiliated. What will our friends thing? What will our family think? Even more bizarre we think about what those who don’t know us will think. I’m not afraid to admit that I’ve been there before, and still am guilty of it at times but I am urging you to give any goal you have a try. I'm here urging you to give it a try because here’s the funny thing about failure, no one really gives a shit about yours.</p>
    
  <p>Here's a story about one of my many failures. In 2014 I got inspired to start my own skateboarding company. I couldn’t tell you exactly where this inspiration came from, but one day I woke up and felt the need to do it. After brainstorming some names for a whole day, I finally came up with a name. It wasn’t perfect by any means, but the domains and socials were available, so I went with it. I named the company Wiscowood Skateboards (later changed to Solace Skate Co).</p>
  
  <p>I’m not being facetious when I say that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I had never had a real business before, nor did I ever have to work with a distributor in order to get products. However thanks to Larry Page and Sergey Brin it’s never been easier to learn something when you have no idea how about. If you’re about to Google who they are, you can thank them too, because they are the founders of Google. Before you know it, I had a few different options of distributors for skateboards in bulk and started reaching out to them. I eventually landed on a skateboarding manufacturer out of California that offered a great product at a fair price. I put together a sketchy skateboard design on Photoshop, placed my order and I was on my way.</p>
  
  <figure class="portrait">

   <figcaption>This was the very first skateboard I (poorly) designed in Photoshop. It was inspired by <a href="https://enjoico.com/" target="_blank">Enjoi Skateboards</a>. Instead of pandas, I used cows. It's safe to say the designs got better over time, much like everything with my business.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>I knew that if I was going to sell skateboards I’d have to offer other items like apparel and stickers. Once again, I had no idea on how to handle any of these items. So once again I turned to the Google machine to help me learn about it. In no time I had an idea of some options to follow up on and within a couple of days I had narrowed down the companies I was wanting to work with. The final piece to the puzzle was a website. I had a little bit of experience in the past with using Wix, so I put together a terrible website that allowed people to buy my products online. I was officially in business!</p>
 

  <p>After operating my skateboarding business for three years, I decided it was time to move on to something new. During those three years, I was able to have a lot of awesome experiences and even more important, I learned a lot of new things. By the time I decided to move on to something new, I had five skaters that I sponsored; multiple skateboard and apparel designs; and my skateboards in a few different shops in Wisconsin.</p>

   <figcaption>Here's a photo of two of my riders, Jake (left) and Cole (right). I wouldn't trade this experience for anything, it was such a blast. Sad that it ever had to come to an end, but all good things must end.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>Despite all the successes I had with my company, it was a failure. I lost a few thousand dollars throughout the three years. I had skateboards that warped due to not selling quick enough. My apparel designs grew stale due to not being able to continuously add new designs. I underpriced my product in hopes to pick up sales, but ultimately just ate into my profits. However what I lost in money or product, I gained in knowledge and insight. Without starting my business there are so many things I would still be oblivious on today. Without starting my company I would have never learned about drop shipping apparel to be able to offer more designs and buy product to order. I would have never attended a city council meeting to plead my case for a skateboarding contest at our local skate park. I would have never learned how to build websites using Adobe Muse and focus on landing pages or Google Analytics. I may have never known how to create an LLC. I may never know what it’s like to have my story written in a newspaper. Most importantly, without starting my skateboarding company I would always wonder what if.</p>

   <figcaption>The local newspaper, The Leader Telegram, heard about the skateboarding competition we were hosting and wanted to interview me for it. A really cool outcome from this failure.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>I tell you this story not to brag about my failing skateboarding business, but to ask you to go after what you’ve always wanted to. I don’t regret for once second creating a skateboarding business that crashed and burned. If anything, when I reflect on those three years I can’t help but smile because of how fun of an experience it all was. Ultimately, that’s what life is all about. Don’t be afraid to start that business, ask out your dream guy/girl, or learn that new skill even if you think you’re not talented enough for it. Don’t be afraid of failure, be afraid of never trying.</p>
   
  <p>Thank you for taking the time to read a story about one of my many failures. I'd be curious to hear about your failure(s) and what positive outcome resulted because of it. If you'd like to share, <a href="mailto:benbiederman@gmail.com">drop me an email</a>, I'd love to read it.</p>
