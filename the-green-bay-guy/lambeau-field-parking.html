    <!-- Review -->
    <section class="blog-content">
        <p>So you pulled the trigger on coming to a Packer game, that’s great! Now, you’re curious as to where you should park when you’re attending the game. Green Bay is quite possibly the most unique stadium experience in all of professional sports, in my opinion. As you get closer to the stadium, you’ll see homeowners standing on their lawns holding signs advertising parking on their lawn for a small fee. Since Green Bay doesn’t have any parking garages by the stadium, homeowners help alleviate the lack of parking by renting out their lawn. Depending on how close to the stadium you park, you can be looking at anywhere from $0 - $40 for a parking spot. Keep in mind, regardless of the price, there are things you’ll want to be mindful of.</p>

        <h5>What to look for in a lawn parking spot:</h5>
        <p>The lawn parking around <a href="lambeau-field.html">Lambeau Field</a> is quite competitive. You’ll see homeowners competing to get customers through a variety of ways. Some offer better perks to parking on their lawn such as bathroom use, tailgating possibilities, and easy in/easy out. To me, the most crucial perk you want to have to a lawn parking spot is easy in/easy out. What this essentially means, they’re not going to park you in. Some lawns will pile cars in on their lawn, and then you’re sitting there waiting for the person in front of you or behind you to leave after a game. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to wait for some DD to get back to his car after trying to round up all their drunk friends who just want to keep partying.</p>

        <h5>"Is there anywhere else I can park aside from someone's lawn?"</h5>
        <p>Absolutely. You’ll find local businesses also selling their parking lot space. Businesses located close to <a href="lambeau-field.html">Lambeau Field</a>, such as <a href="the-bar.html">The Bar</a>, <a href="green-bay-distillery.html">Green Bay Distillery</a>, or <a href="krolls.html">Kroll’s</a>, will sell parking spaces on game day. There’s definitely pros and cons to both ways of parking.</p>


        <h5>"What's better? Parking on someone's lawn or in a business parking lot?"</h5>
        <p>It depends what you’re more comfortable with and what you prefer. Generally you can find more affordable parking by parking in someone’s lawn. Since it is such a competitive market for the homes in the community, you’ll usually find really reasonably priced parking spots on someone’s lawn. The only downside that comes with that is that you sometimes have to walk a little more than parking at a residing business. Also, when parking on a business lot, you get the consistency that comes with a parking lot. Your parking spot is lined perfectly so you know where to park and you can usually tailgate in those business lots. The atmosphere can be a lot more rewarding for those who are coming to a game for the first time because you’ll be surrounded by fans who are also tailgating. Another option would be to buy a parking pass in Lambeau Field before the game, then you’ll be parking as close as you can get! However, at the time of writing this, a parking spot at <a href="lambeau-field.html">Lambeau Field</a> would cost you $40. There are parking lots that are more of a walk to the stadium that allow you to tailgate as well, so you would get the best of all worlds with that option. It all really depends on what you’re looking for as far as price, location, and experience.</p>

        <h5>"Do I have to pay for parking?"</h5>
        <p>If you don’t mind some walking, then usually you can park for free. Anytime I go to a game now, I park for free. There are a couple of negatives to parking for free. The first being that it’s usually a lot harder to tailgate since you’re parking on a street for free. The other obvious negative is that you may have to do a little walking to get to the stadium, however, after a cold game it’s nice to be able to thaw your legs on the way back to the car. What I really like about parking for free is the fact that I can set myself up for an easier exit. I can identify areas that are located by stop signs, which will help me get out of the cluster of traffic. If you don’t think about your exit while parking, you may be in a spot where you’re sitting for an opening in traffic in order to leave.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are obviously many options on where to park when going to a Packers game, I hope this guide helped as much as possible. Have any questions I didn’t answer?
