        <p>Place to stay, uhhh…</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of the most daunting things to figure out when coming to a Packers game is the idea of where you’re going to stay. For a lot of out-of-towners, the idea of trying to find a hotel that works with your situation is a tough one. There are so many factors that go into making this decision, distance from Lambeau, price, and terms of the hotel.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>The Cheap Route:</b> If you’re looking for the cheapest option because you spent all your money on a sweet new Packers jersey for the game, your best bet will be to stay outside of Green Bay. Surrounding cities like Shawano or Appleton, get about 30 minutes away. When you make this journey out of Green Bay, you’ll generally avoid having to stay multiple nights and having to pay double rates. Another perk to going this route, the demand won’t be nearly the same as if you would try to find a hotel in Green Bay. So you don’t always have to book as far in advance when you stay outside of Green Bay. If you’re planning on staying in a hotel in Green Bay during a Packers game, expect to have to book multiple nights at an increased rate per night, often times the rate is doubled.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, if staying in Green Bay is an absolute must for you, I’d recommend the Bay Motel located on Military Ave. It’s nothing flashy by any means, but it’s a motel to crash for the time you’re there. I’m guessing it’s a two-day mandatory stay as well at an increased rate, but their rates are pretty modest. Be sure to book way in advance, otherwise you’re not getting a room there. The nice part about Bay Motel is that it’s located 1.4 miles from Lambeau Field, so walking to the stadium isn’t unrealistic for those who like walking those distances. 1.4 miles is obviously easier to walk when it’s fall compared to winter, but it can also save you money on parking if you go that route!</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>The Convenient Route:</b> If you’re thinking, “Man, I’m going to be plastered, so I need to find somewhere close so I can just walk to the stadium”, get ready to open your wallet. There are a lot of options within walking distance whether you’re staying at a hotel or a party house. Across the street from Lambeau Field are party houses that you can rent. I’ve personally never stayed in these, but I’ve heard they can be pretty pricey. The rate I’ve heard some of the party housees go for as much as $3,500 for a single weekend stay.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Along with the party houses there are a plenty of hotels in the area where you won’t need to do much walking. Some examples of those hotels would be Lodge Koehler, Best Western, Quality Inn and many others. If you Google search hotels by Lambeau Field, you can find all the options near by. I often get asked if there are any hotels to avoid. I personally wouldn't stay at the Arena Motel or the Economy Inn. Feel free to look them up and make a decision on it yourself, but just my opinion.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you are planning on staying at any of these spots, I suggest booking in advance because these rooms will fill-up fast. As I’ve stated above as well, you’ll be looking at having to stay multiple nights at a much higher rate than a normal day.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b>The Other Route:</b> Another option that could work for you would be Airbnb. I know not everyone wants to go this route, but with the popularity of Airbnb increasing, the amount of rooms available also increase. This could be a good option for those that are comfortable staying over at someone’s house they’ve never met before. I’ve personally never stayed at one, so I’m not sure the terms, I’m sure they vary, but you may get more value from this route because hosts often offer great perks to their guests. This could be a more cost friendly option, but obviously every Airbnb stay is a different experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are obviously many options to sort through when decided on which hotel you can stay at, I hope this guide helped as much as possible. Have any questions I didn’t answer? I’d love to help you as much as I can, feel free to shoot me an email, message on social media, or a text so I can answer any of your questions.</p>
