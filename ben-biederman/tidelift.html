        <p>I have recently stumbled upon your open position at Tidelift, and I would certainly be remiss if I didn't take the opportunity to apply for the position of Customer Success Manager.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, the most important part about this whole application is what I could bring to Tidelift, so I'd like to take this opportunity to share some of the benefits of having me on the Tidelift team:</p>

        <h3>Customer Service</h3>
        <p>Without customers, a company can't exist. I pride myself on giving the best customer service possible. I have won awards for my customer service, as well as impacted how companies conduct their training. Customers are always a key focus in any position I have and providing them with outstanding service is crucial for that. I know anyone can say that they're great with customers, but here's an actual quote from feedback we received during my tenure at Arby's as a manager:</p>

        <p><em>I'm writing to you because of the Arby's in Menomonie, Wisconsin. You need to be aware that this is probably your best Arby's restaurant in the United States. I am always amazed at the level of quality service my fiance and I receive there. They go above and beyond what I would expect from a fast food restaurant. The most friendly people on earth work there and I especially have to mention Ben Biederman who is the manager there. WOW! He's one of the nicest guys I've ever met and he couldn't treat us any better. He goes out of his way to make our dinning experience first class. Please do something to commend him on his awesome level of work. You should be honored to have him employed. Please let everyone working at that restaurant how much we appreciate them.<br><br>Thank you,<br> Patrick Walsh</em>

        <h3>Eagerness to learn</h3>
        <p>I love learning new things. I learned shortly after college that just because my schooling was finished didn't mean my education was. I'm always eager to learn new skills that can benefit my personal life, as well as my professional life. In the past year or so I've branched out to learning how to build websites using HTML/CSS and I'm now focusing on learning JavaScript. If you'd like to get a full idea of what I'm working on learning or doing in 2020, feel free to check out my <a href="2020-goals.html">2020 goals</a>. If given the opportunity, I'd work to know all I could about Tidelift and how I can provide more value to the company and customers.</p>
        
        <h3>Self-motivated</h3>
        <p>Motivation is never something I lacked. Over the years it has just gotten more prevalent. During my free time, I enjoy working on a couple side hustles. One is based around my <a href="http://thegreenbayguy.com/" target="_blank">passion for football</a> and the other (which is in the works currently) is based around <a href="http://keywordcoffee.com/" target="_blank">my passion for coffee</a>. This motivation bleeds into my professional life as well. I enjoy identifying areas that can be more efficient and implementing processes that can make life easier for myself and my teammates.</p>
        
        <p>This is by no means all that I can bring to Tidelift but I feel that these are some of the important things to mention. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for your time. I can only imagine how many applicants you'll get for this position, and I greatly appreciate you taking the time to learn more about me. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me via <a href="mailto:benbiederman@gmail.com">email</a> or phone (715) 308-1521. Thank you again.</p>
