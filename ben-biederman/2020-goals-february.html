  <h2>My 2020 Goals - February Update</h2>
  <h5>- Published February 28, 2020 -</h5>
  
  <p>Back again with another update on how 2020 is shaping up for me. February wasn’t as productive as January, but I was able to keep moving towards some goals and have decided to add more to my plate for 2020. JavaScript is still going to be my big focus, but I realize there are other goals that will complement this knowledge as well. Let’s see the update:</p>
    
  <div class="goals-blog">
  <h4>Create personal website:</h4>
   <p>Personal website was created back in January. However, I did spend some time in February reworking it a tad bit. I wanted to implement some JavaScript into it since I’ve been learning that. I created a JavaScript mobile menu for my website, with the help of YouTube. I think it’s definitely helped add some smoothness to it. I’m still planning on adding new content every week or two to the website, just to continue documenting what I’m doing and my thoughts. Depending on how busy I get with other goals this year, it may slow down a bit though. We’ll see.</p>

    <p>Status:</p>
    <p class="completed">Completed</p>
   
   </div>
  
  <h4>Read 20 books:</h4>
  <p>I’m still behind on this goal. I’ve only completed reading two books so far this year. My big focus has been on other areas than reading, but I’m still getting some time in reading every night. It will be very odd for me if I don’t even hit 20 books read this year considering I’ve been averaging around 40/year. However, I’m using the time I would be reading to focus on my goals, which feels more important right now.</p>

   </div>
  
  <h4>Rebuild side hustle website:</h4>
  <p>It was rebuilt earlier this year to get rid of all the errors in the code. I’m thinking some slight additions to the code will be warranted sometime this year though. I’d like to add some JavaScript to that as well. As I learn more about SEO too I'd like to really see how I can increase my website visits.</p>

  <h4>Learn JavaScript:</h4>
  <p>I’ve been battling with JavaScript pretty much all of February. I completed my Codecademy class on front-end web development but have struggled mentally on if I feel I can really understand on to put it all together. It’s such a mental battle every time you’re learning something new like this. I’m going to keep moving forward on it all. I plan on watching MMTUTS JavaScript course in the near future to help me get a better idea of it all. Also, I’d like to enroll in The Odin Project, since they have a front-end web development course as well. The Odin Project is more of a independent course, so it may help the ideas stick better for me. I’ll be giving more of an update on this in my coding journey blog posts.</p>

  <h4>Learn to make homemade pasta:</h4>
  <p>Still perfecting the recipe, but have definitely made my fair share of homemade pasta this year!</p>
   
   <div class="status">
    <p>Status:</p>
    <p class="completed">Completed</p>
   
   </div>
  
  <h4>Obtain Google Analytics certificate:</h4>
  <p>I have started the Google Analytics course offered online by Google. I’m a little more than halfway completed with the beginner’s course. While I have a decent understanding of how to use Google Analytics from my years of playing around in it, it’s really helped me understand how to hone into some data that I want. I’m excited to keep going on the courses and hopefully become an analytics know-it-all.</p>

  <h4>Identify areas to monetize side hustle:</h4>
  <p>This one is still on the back burner. Ideally I’d like to have this done by April or so, that way I can get designs going for merchandise and line everything up. I should probably also figure out some content ideas for this season as well. I put so much into the 2019 season that I've just been feeling like I need a mental break away from it for the time being. I'm conflicted if that's a good idea or not.</p>

  <h4>Get ordained:</h4>
  <p>I’m officially Reverend Biederman. At least that’s what I’ve been getting referred to in emails from the company I got ordained through. It was a tough process to get ordained, it took all of 20 seconds. I need to read the book they’ve sent me on performing weddings and also figure out which clerk of courts I need to call to get everything situated. I’ve left some voicemails, but haven’t heard back yet. I have about 4 months until the wedding, it’s going to go fast.</p>

   <h4><font color="green">*NEW*</font> Learn SEO:</h4>
   <p>I feel like I’ve been battling with learning SEO for a while now. It’s such a versatile skill to know since it can help your content be found. I’ve decided to draw a line in the sand and say I’m going to get a better idea of SEO in 2020. I’d like to implement the strategies in a test website to see how much traffic I can grow for the remainder of the year starting at zero. I’ve enrolled in some SEO courses online to get a better lay of the land and will be implementing these strategies. </p>

   <h4><font color="green">*NEW*</font> Create a new side project:</h4>
   <p>I’ve been going back and forth on this one. On one hand I have a side hustle that’s already established with over 18,000 likes on Facebook and 4,000 followers on Instagram. However, the drawbacks to it are that it’s based around people coming to Green Bay for Packers games, which makes it very, very cyclical. I’ll see my website views skyrocket during Packers game weeks and plummet during the offseason. If I’m going to incorporate what I’m learning from SEO into a website, I think doing it for something that’s not so cyclical will be beneficial. Another plus side to my new side hustle idea is that it doesn’t bring out the crazies quite as much as sports seems to do. Anytime you have sports related content you have people who are passionate for and against your team. This can create some annoying situations to deal with. I know there's no such thing as a perfect venture, but I’m looking forward to starting another one. I’ve started the logo design process, maybe I’ll roll it out next month? More to come.</p>

  <p>It’s been a busy month. I cannot believe we’re 1/6th done with 2020 already. It’s a good and bad thing how quickly time seems to go. Before you know it, I’ll be 70 years old, reflecting back on my life. I want to make sure I’m utilizing the time properly, and not going to regret anything when I’m looking back in another 40 years. 1/6th done, let’s make the other 5/6ths matter</p>
